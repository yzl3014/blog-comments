> Providing comment service for my blog.

After using [Waline](https://waline.js.org/) for several years, I decided to replace my blog comment service with [Giscus](https://giscus.app/) because the [LeanCloud](https://www.leancloud.app/) it relied on announced it was [ceasing operations](https://docs.leancloud.app/sdk/announcements/sunset-announcement/), and migrating the comment data there was a troublesome thing, and moreover, reliable, easy-to-use, and free solutions are extremely rare now. So this time I chose GitHub.

This repository officially launched on January 30, 2026, with its _Discussions_ serving as the comment data store.
